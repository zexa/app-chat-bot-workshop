## Paysera Chat Bot Workshop
Thanks Paysera, it was fun!

Was too lazy and tired to implement a score system so there's that, but it would be pretty straightforward.

Simply add the score to the trivia-status.json via the `TriviaProvider.php` file.

Oh, I implemented a basic `!trivia` command and an `!answer` command. Please try them out!

Feel free to poke around my poopy code. Criticism would be awesome. 

Reading lists and topics to research are amazing and highly appreciated.

Detailed feedback is not something I actually expect, but would be absolutely sick.

And a chance to participate in a *payed* internship would be a gift from the gods!
